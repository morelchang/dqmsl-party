DQMSL PARTY

I'm trying to develop a app for users to create, manage their DQMSL monster ranch. and provide advanced feature like teamup, grouping, or tagging their monsters.

### Search Monster
search monster by serial number
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/morelchang/dqmsl-party/blob/master/src/main/webapp/list_mons.html

### TODO
* list ranch, add monster to ranch, this is the most important feature of this app
* enhance search result with stars, rank, system, and monster type.
